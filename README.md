##  About The Project

I was tired of finding expired food in my pantry and fridge, so I decided to build a solution.

I created **Shelf Buddy**, a free and simple web app that tracks your items and provides accurate shelf-life data from its built-in database. You can use it to manage your food, medicine, and any other perishable items to help reduce waste and save money.

This was a full-stack project for me, and I also configured it with a sitemap and meta tags for Google (SEO).

##  Key Features
*  **Expiry Prediction:** Get accurate shelf-life data based on storage (room temp, refrigerated, or frozen).
*  **Reduce Waste:** Get a clear view of what's expiring soon.
*  **Seamless Deployment** Deployed in free tier of Render
*  **Responsive UI** Clean, mobile-friendly interface built.
